/**
 * FHEdback Smart Contract Integration
 * 
 * This module provides the configuration and interfaces for interacting with
 * the FHEdback confidential survey smart contracts deployed on Sepolia testnet.
 * 
 * Architecture:
 * - Factory Pattern: Central factory creates individual survey contracts
 * - Proxy Pattern: Upgradeable contracts using OpenZeppelin proxies
 * - FHE Integration: Fully Homomorphic Encryption for confidential surveys
 * 
 * Updated: September 1, 2025
 * Status: âœ… Sepolia contracts deployed and verified
 * Network: Sepolia Testnet (Chain ID: 11155111)
